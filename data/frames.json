Here are the laureates and their specific contributions:  1. **Max Planck (1918)** - Planck is considered the father of quantum theory. He introduced the idea of energy quanta and derived Planck's radiation law, which describes the electromagnetic radiation emitted by a black body in thermal equilibrium.     2. **Albert Einstein (1921)** - Although awarded the Nobel Prize in 1921, Einstein made crucial contributions to quantum theory with his explanation of the photoelectric effect, which demonstrated the particle nature of light.  3. **Niels Bohr (1922)** - Bohr received his Nobel Prize for his contributions to our understanding of atomic structure and radiation. His Bohr model of the atom incorporated quantum theory and explained how electrons could have stable orbits.  4. **Johannes Stark (1919)** - Stark was awarded the Nobel Prize for his discovery of the Doppler effect in canal rays and the splitting of spectral lines in electric fields (the Stark effect), both phenomena that provided insights into atomic structure and quantum mechanics.  5. **James Franck and Gustav Hertz (1925)** - Franck and Hertz's Nobel Prize was awarded for their experiments on electron impacts in atoms, which confirmed quantum energy levels within atoms.",

The opening lines of this book later inspired a song by a band.

        "Question": "In physics, when speaking of classical mechanics, there is an infamous problem that involves taking the initial positions and velocities of three point masses that orbit each other and attempting to calculate their trajectories. There is no general closed-form solution for this infamous problem. French mathematicians in the 18th century focused on solving this problem in regards to astronomical motion, specifically how the Moon rotates on its apsides. Their work led to a solution using Newton's laws of physics and the Discrete Fourier Transformation (DFT), which ultimately changed how sailors were able to determine longitude at sea. The inventor of the device that would revolutionize naval navigation using these new principles and proofs spent how many years testing and perfecting his work?",
